Sparkfun Temperature and Magnetometer Breakout for Arduino

This code demonstrates using the TMP102 sensor and the HMC5883L sensor
together on the Arduino I2C bus.  The magnetometer output is displayed in
nanoTesla (nT) for comparison to model values, e.g.

The code is based on examples from the Sparkfun website but was modernized
and additional display information was added.
